The principle of working with customers is as follows: the customer calls the phone number connected to the modem or the incoming line number of the internal PBX. The modem picks up the phone, and the customer is offered a voice menu recorded by the client.\nFor example:",
        "descr2": "“Hello. You have called the reference and information service of the company 'BERLIO'. To check the balance under the contract, press '1'. To receive a sales report for the current month by fax, press '2'. To receive a sales report for the previous month by fax, press '3'. To connect with a manager, press '9'.”",
        "descr3": "The customer presses the corresponding digit on the telephone keypad to obtain the required information. Please note that the customer must enter all digits in tone mode. If the customer used pulse dialing to call the city number, they must press '*' before entering the first digit to switch the phone (fax) to tone dialing. The customer can enter all digits either during the pause or during voice messages.",
        "descr4": "The initial menu with a specific pause is repeated several times. The number of repetitions and the pause duration are determined in the program settings. If the customer does not press any digit within the specified time, they are connected to a manager (as if they had pressed '9'). If the pressed digit does not correspond to any function, the customer is informed, 'An incorrect choice has been made,' and the menu is repeated.",
        "descr5": "When selecting option '9', the customer is transferred to a manager. The manager's phone number is specified in the program settings. This option is only available during the specified time, for example, only on weekdays from 9:00 to 18:00.",
        "descr6": "When selecting option '1', the customer is prompted to enter a five-digit contract number, after which they are informed of the remaining funds on the contract. When selecting menu options '2' or '3', the customer is prompted to enter the contract number followed by the '#' key, after which a Sales Report for the current or previous period, respectively, is sent to the customer by fax.",

'Family Card' — the ability to issue an unlimited number of additional cards with a single card account (e.g., when a husband, wife, and children use one card account). In this case, all loyalty program transactions are processed through the main card's account, while any of the additional cards can be used for customer identification"

        "descrHeader3": "Advantages of using contactless electronic cards:",
        "descr3": "Longer card lifespan, as contactless payments naturally result in less wear and tear. Convenience and speed of payment at gas stations, cafes, supermarkets, etc. Cards and readers are well-protected against fraud.",
        "descr4": "Firstly, the cards have internal password protection (separately for writing and reading data), with the password set not for the entire card but for each segment (there can be up to 10 segments on a 'Mifare 1K' card), allowing some information to be protected from both reading and writing, and some only from writing.",
        "descr5": "Secondly, card readers of our production do not record the transmitted information directly onto the card. All information is first encrypted and only then written to the card in encrypted form. Additionally, random data, card identifiers (written by the manufacturer and unchangeable), and calculated control values are mixed into the information. Moreover, the card maintains additional control counters that must change according to a predefined algorithm whenever data is modified, ensuring that even identical operations with the card produce completely different data and control values each time.",
        "descr6": "All this eliminates any possibility of duplicating the card or altering its information (any such operations will render the card invalid due to mismatched control codes during decryption).",
        "descr7": "Similarly, it is impossible to alter data during the interaction between the computer and the reader. Communication lines never transmit the actual data, only their encrypted representation mixed with random data and calculated control values. Even identical operations have completely different representations each time, meaning that even if data is replicated and the exchange is simulated, the system will consider all data invalid!",
        "descr8": "Similarly, all communications with the loyalty center, offline systems, and gas station management systems are encrypted and subject to additional controls. Additionally, during contactless payments, the card remains in the customer's hands, reducing the risk of unauthorized manipulation by staff.",

The bonus can be anything, limited only by your imagination. Most often, bonuses are converted into monetary equivalents or the products offered, such as liters of fuel, etc. One usage option is crediting unclaimed change to the customer's card",
